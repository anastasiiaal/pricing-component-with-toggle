## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS (Flexbox, CSS Grid, etc.)
- [Sassy CSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- NPM 
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) JS library
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/)

### What I learned

This project's main goal was to practice React.js framework.
To make this whole thing work, I had to learn about React components, about the concept of state and other things that used to be new to me.

Having my index.html file look like that:
```html
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <script type="module" src="/src/index.jsx"></script>
</body>
```
was quite unusual and exciting.

Making these lines 
```js
function App() {
  return (
    <main>
      <BgWaves />
      <Main />
      <Attribution />
    </main>
  )
}
```
generate the whole page content was thrilling!
